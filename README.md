# Nuclear Red
A text-based adventure game I developed as part of a group for GAME 101. This project has been moved from its previous VCS page, and unfortunatley none of the git history came with it.

*Nuclear Red* features the first chapter in an unfortunatley never completed game, powered by a complex regex-based text parsing engine, and featuing a retro-inspired amber-colored "terminal" in which to interact with the game.
